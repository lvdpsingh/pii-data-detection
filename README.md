# Enhancing Privacy and Accessibility in Educational Data through Automated PII Detection

This repository contains the resources and documentation for the Master's Project titled "Enhancing Privacy and Accessibility in Educational Data through Automated PII Detection", authored by Lovedeep Singh under the guidance of Professor Desmund Lun at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Graduate School - Camden.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the development of automated techniques to efficiently detect and remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from educational texts. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning models, this initiative aims to reduce the manual effort involved in PII detection, thereby enhancing the privacy and accessibility of educational datasets.

## Key Components

- **Abstract**: Introduction to the necessity of automated PII detection in educational contexts.
- **Introduction**: Explores the challenges and needs for PII detection within the vast data ecosystems of educational institutions.
- **Problem Definition and Objectives**: Detailed explanation of the project's aims and the specific problems it addresses.
- **Related Work**: Overview of existing tools and technologies in the field of PII detection.
- **Methodology**: In-depth description of the methodologies employed including data collection, preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
- **Results**: Insights into the model comparisons and the effectiveness of the applied methods.
- **Challenges and Future Scope**: Discussion on encountered challenges and future directions for this research area.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes the achievements and the impact of the project on educational data privacy.
- **References**: Cites all sources and tools utilized throughout the project.
